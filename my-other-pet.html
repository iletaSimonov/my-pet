    <h3>Adoption</h3>
    <h4>A look back at adopting Felix</h4>
    <p>I found Felix on Craigslist and he stood out to me in the sea of kitties waiting to be rehomed. He has these ice blue eyes and beautiful markings on his coat. I reached out to a woman named Loretta who then called me and told me about Felix's traumatic life. His previous owner had an aggressive form of alzheimers disease. So my poor little Felix was not living in a loving home. So I made my way over to Loretta's and met the little guy. He was extremely shy, and frankly, terrified. But I knew with patiece, tender love and care, that I could get him to trust me!

    <h3>What Felix is like now</h3>

    <h4>Warming Up</h4>
    <p>Although Felix is still very timid and shy, I know that deep down he trusts me. Although, he;s not as outgoing as his little brother Teddy,he still has his quirks! He gets the zoomies and wrestles and plays with strings, just like any other cat. He isn't the most affectionte kitty, but he is still a good one!

    <p>Thanks for getting to know Felix!</p>
